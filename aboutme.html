                    I'm Emma - originally from Massachusetts and now living in Denver, CO!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I've always loved learning and have had interests spanning disciplines from science and technology to art and design. Going into college,
                    it was very important to me to develop a skillset fit for a well-rounded engineer and one that would allow me to bring imagined projects to life.
                    This led me to MIT. I graduated in 2021 with a BS in Materials Science and Engineering and a concentration in Chinese. Throughout my time there,
                    I was able to gain and develop skills in not just material science but also in areas such as software and hardware engineering, product design and fabrication,
                    human computer interaction, robotics, and immersive technology! Check out more on my portfolio page :)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After graduating, I spent time interning as a simulation engineer for a start up called Lifespans, Ltd. I worked on developing medical implant simulations that 
                    could better model bone and foam failure modes with the goal of expediting the implant protyping and design process. Starting in 2022 and up to the present, I've been working
                    for Lockheed Martin Space as a Materials Engineer supporting digital tool creation and additive manufacturing production.
